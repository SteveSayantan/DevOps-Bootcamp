## Brief
Here, we have two ec2 instances. In one of those, we shall install **ansible**, and perform various tasks in the other instance using **ansible** .

[Ansible Docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/index.html)

## Installation in Ubuntu

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

## Ansible Playbook
A script written in Bash is called Bash Script. A script written in Python is called Python Script. Similarly, a file containing Ansible script in YAML is called Ansible Playbook. Playbooks are reusable and can be version-controlled.

## Ansible Adhoc Commands
If we need to run some basic commands say, `ls` or `echo hello world`, we don't create a bash file for it. Similarly, for simple tasks, we need not write Ansible Playbooks, we can directly run Ansible CLI commands. Such commands are called [ad-hoc commands](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/command_guide/intro_adhoc.html) .

Default syntax to write ad-hoc command is as follows:
```bash
ansible -i path-to-inventory-file host_pattern -m module -a args 
```
The targeted **host** must reside in the provided inventory file.

## Inventory File

To get started with Ansible, first, we need to create an inventory file. An inventory is a single file with a list of hosts and groups. It is generally structured in INI or YAML format.

The default inventory file is `/etc/ansible/hosts`. We can use it, but, for convenience, we can also specify a different inventory file at the command line using the `-i <path>` option.

e.g., 
- First we create an inventory file in current working dir: `touch inventory`

- we specify hosts in it, as we need to specify the user for logging in.
- `ansible_host` — tells Ansible which network address to connect to for that host (IP or FQDN).
- `ansible_user` — tells Ansible which remote user to use when establishing the connection. By default, Ansible tries to connect with the username we are using on the control node.

  ```bash
  # inventory file: inventory.ini (INI format)

  # explicit syntax
  ansible_host=10.38.23.212 ansible_user=ubuntu
  ansible_host=10.38.24.215 ansible_user=harry
  
  # or, using shorthand syntax (not recommended for real usage)
  ubuntu@10.38.23.212
  harry@10.38.24.215
  ```

- now, we execute an ad-hoc command: ` ansible -i ./inventory.ini all -m 'shell' -a 'touch testFile.txt' `.

  - **all** is a pattern specifying all the hosts in **inventory** , i.e. the command will execute for all of the hosts. For details, check [patterns](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_patterns.html#intro-patterns).

  - Instead of **all**, we can also specify a single host, like: ` ansible -i ./inventory.ini w.x.y.z -m 'shell' -a 'touch testFile.txt' `. But the host must reside in **inventory** .

- **-m** flag is used to specify module (As we use shell command, we use 'shell'). This module is responsible for execution of any assigned task. To listing all the modules use `ansible-doc -l`. The default module for the ansible command-line utility is the `command` module. For details, check [all modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_all_modules.html).

- **-a** flag is used to specify the argument/command.

Learn more about connection variables (e.g. `ansible_host`, `ansible_user`) from the  [docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#connecting-to-hosts-behavioral-inventory-parameters)

### Small Diagnostics

- See what Ansible will connect to and with what vars for a specific host. Use `--list` flag (with no args) instead to get info about all hosts:
  ```bash
  ansible-inventory -i inventory --host web1
  ```
- Confirm connection and the user (quick "whoami" test):
  ```bash
  ansible web1 -i inventory -m command -a "whoami"
  ```
- Show gathered facts and verify connectivity (useful to confirm SSH):
  ```bash
  ansible web1 -i inventory -m setup
  ```

## Grouping hosts in Inventory
To perform actions on a particular set of hosts, we create groups in inventory file.

e.g., here we have two hosts under **dbservers** group and one host under **webservers** group.
```bash
  # inventory file: inventory.ini (INI format)
  
  [dbservers]
  a.b.c.d
  e.f.g.h
  [webservers]
  w.x.y.z

```

Now, we can run a command for all the hosts under a particular group (here, **webservers**),

`ansible -i ./inventory.ini webservers -m 'shell' -a 'touch hello.html'`

## Write Playbook
A playbook consists of one or more ‘plays’ in an ordered list. Each play executes part of the overall goal of the playbook, running one or more tasks. In the following playbook, we install nginx and start nginx.

- First, we need to create an yaml file, say *playbook.yml* . 


  ```yaml
  ---  # This indicates the start of a playbook

  - name: Install and Start Nginx  # we can give any name to the play

    hosts: all  # execute the play for all hosts in inventory

    become: true # for using root privileges

    tasks: # now we specify tasks to be performed

     - name: Install nginx   # we can give any name to the task
       apt:    # we want to use the apt module
       name: nginx   # name of the package
       state: present # to install nginx

     - name: Start nginx  # this is the name our second task
       service:  # we want to use service module
        name: nginx  # we are interested about nginx service
        state: started  # to start the service

  # we can write multiple plays in single file as shown

  - name: Second play
    [...]

  ```

- Now, we execute this playbook in the main server using **ansible-playbook** command:

  `ansible-playbook -i ./inventory.ini playbook.yml`

In the managed node,
- Check the status of nginx by `systemctl status nginx`

- Stop nginx by `sudo systemctl stop nginx`.

### Privilege Escalation

```yaml
become: yes
```
is shorthand for:

```yaml
become: yes
become_user: root  # Who to become (default is root)
become_method: sudo # How to become (sudo, su, pbrun, doas, etc.)
become_flags: "" # Extra options passed to the become_method command; none by default 
```
If we write
```yaml
become: yes
become_method: su
```
the final effective settings are:
```yaml
become: yes

become_method: su # ← we overrode this

become_user: root # ← still default (not reset)

become_flags: "" # ← still default
```
