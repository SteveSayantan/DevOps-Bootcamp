## Introduction to YAML
- YAML was previously known as **Yet Another Markup Language**. But now, it stands for **YAML Ain't Markup Language**, as it can store objects unlike markup language which can only store document. 

- It is basically a human readable language that can represent data. It is used to store data, similar to XML and JSON.

- We can't perform logical operations in YAML. It is not a programming language.

- Data Serialization: A process of converting the data of an object into stream of bytes which captures the state of that object and is also easily transferable among different devices.

  E.g., Converting some object into JSON format is called serialization. Now, it can be stored in a file or memory.

- The reverse of the above process is called deserialization.

- Data serialization formats are JSON, YAML, JSON.

- It is mostly used to store configuration files, to maintain logs, caches etc.

- YAML files have extension *.yml* or *.yaml* . 

- YAML is case-sensitive.

- It does not support multi-line comment.

- The benefits of YAML are:
  - Simple and easy to read. Parsing is easy.
  - It has a strict syntax, indentation is important. We use *space* for indenting.
  - Easily convertable to JSON, XML.
  - Most languages support YAML.
  - It can represent complex data.
